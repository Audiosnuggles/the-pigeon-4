        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Your privacy is important. This application is designed to be as data-minimal as possible.</p>
        
        <p><strong>1. No Tracking:</strong><br>
        We do not use any tracking tools, cookies, or analytics services (like Google Analytics).</p>

        <p><strong>2. Local Storage:</strong><br>
        All your created patterns and bank settings are stored locally on your own device using "Local Storage". This data never leaves your computer and is not accessible to us.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Server Log Files:</strong><br>
        The hosting provider of this website automatically collects and stores information in "server log files" which your browser transmits to us (e.g., IP address, browser type, time of request). This is technically necessary to provide and secure the website.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Your Rights:</strong><br>
        You have the right to request information about your stored data at any time. Since we do not store personal information, there is usually nothing to report.</p> Have fun with The Pigeon ! <br>
